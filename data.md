  <p>Perhaps you want to understand new tools to help you open up your own data, or a dataset. Or maybe you're interested in data transparency or preregistration.</p>

  <p>Open Data Day is a mixture of talks, workshops and, of course, hacking will enable you to learn as you help others learn.</p>

  <p>Doors open at 10am with a welcome from 10pm starting with Casper Addyman (Goldsmiths), and Edwin Burns (Hacksmiths), before hearing from Olivia (University College London). Weâ€™ll look at ways to get the most out of the day and Mollie (OpenCorporates) will be running a workshop.</p>

  <p>After an afternoon of hacking show and tell will be at 5pm and we will be finishing at 6pm.</p>
