          <h5>What is a game jam?</h5>
          <p>Game Jams are invention marathons for developers, designers, interactive storytellers and more. During the event, participants will design a game around the theme and show off their projects in a friendly show & tell at the end.</p>

          <h5>Do I need a team?</h5>
          <p>You don’t need a team to take part; it’s perfectly acceptable to create a solo project.

As organisers, we’ll do our best to encourage and facilitate teamwork across the weekend.</p>
