  <p>With a less than generous population of women and non-binary people in computing, it can sometimes feel that there is a lack of support and diversity within the industry. This event is for individuals who would like to help build a stronger community at goldsmiths, to share, create and learn.</p><p>We would like to ensure that everyone in computing has the opportunity to have an exciting and positive experience whilst studying or researching. Use this event to make friends, learn, and get inspired. We will have talented individuals speak about their careers and experiences as educators, researchers and creators.</p>
