          <h5>What is Hebocon?</h5>
          <p>Imagine Robot Wars. Now imagine Robot Wars if no one knew what they were doing. Hebocon is a robot sumo wrestling competition for the technically ungifted. Up to 32 robots will fight on an arena and one will be crowned victorious!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
          <h5>Do I need any skill?</h5>
          <p>Not at all, and that's what makes this fun. We'll be running a beginner-level electronics workshop and will provide all basic materials to get some motors moving back and forward.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
          <h5>What should I bring?</h5>
          <p>If you have anything you want to incorporate into your sumo robot, please bring it along. We'll raid a charity shop for inspiration props.</p>

          <h5>Do I need a team?</h5>
          <p>You don’t need a team to take part; it’s perfectly acceptable to create a robot by yourself. However, during the event itself, there will be opportunities to share ideas and connect with your fellow builders to form a team. There will also be a cap at 32 robots, at which point we may add peopl to your team.</p>
