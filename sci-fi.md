          <h5>What is a hackathon?</h5>
          <p>Hackathons are invention marathons for developers, designers, psychologists, researchers and more. During the event, participants ('hackers') will build projects that answer our challenges to build awesome creative projects.</p>

          <h5>Do I need a team?</h5>
          <p>You don’t need a team to take part; it’s perfectly acceptable to create a solo project. However, during the event itself, there will be opportunities to share ideas and connect with your fellow hackers to form a team. As organisers, we’ll do our best to encourage and facilitate teamwork across the weekend.</p>

          <h5>Can I start before?</h5>
          <p>While you can explore ideas before the event, you shouldn't start your project before the event itself and still enter the challenges. If you want to bring an existing project to the table, we encourage full disclosure and honesty.</p>
