one_line: A hackathon exploring companionship, intimacy & sexuality.
tagline: Should Taboo Stifle Innovation?

description: |
  <p>Applications for the hackathon have now closed.</p><p>In 2016, we ran the first Sex Tech Hack in Europe. Over 50 attendees from a range of backgrounds joined us for two days of learning, building and sharing (ideas, that is). We had coverage from <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23331130-100-how-to-build-better-sex-robots-stop-making-them-look-human">New Scientist</a>, <a href="https://www.girlonthenet.com/2016/12/21/amazing-inventions-from-the-goldsmiths-sex-tech-hack/">Girl on the Net</a>, and <a href="http://www.makery.info/en/2016/12/20/au-premier-sex-tech-hack-un-hackathon-sur-la-sexualite-a-londres/">Makery</a>. You can check out all 14 project videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDmeXp90KI9leIRVQGsrOZvFXVo28F8wO">YouTube</a>.</p>
  <p>In 2017, we're going to make it bigger and better than before - inviting more hackers from around the world to build exciting new sex technologies. The challenges for this year are 'intimacy', 'accessibility' and 'personalisation'.</p>
  <p>On Friday November 24, we'll also be running a day-long conference to encourage discussion around these themes. Free tickets are available <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/sex-tech-hack-ii-discussion-day-tickets-39365838282">here</a>.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
          <h5>What is a hackathon?</h5>
          <p>Hackathons are invention marathons for developers, designers, psychologists, researchers and more. During the event, participants ('hackers') will build projects that answer our challenges to build awesome creative projects.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
          <h5>Who owns the projects?</h5>
          <p>All projects built at this event belongs completely to the teams. However, to generate the widest benefit from this event, we encourage attendees to provide Open Source licenses for the results of their work.</p>
        </div>

          <h5>What should I bring?</h5>
          <p>All participants will need to bring their laptop, charger(s) and any other devices they wish to work on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
          <h5>How much does it cost?</h5>
          <p>We want to make this event accessible for everyone, so there is no charge to enter. To make this possible, we need sponsorship. If you are interested in supporting, please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
          <h5>Who is this event for?</h5>
          <p>Anyone! You do not need to be a student to attend this event. We will work to ensure that there is a diverse range of people, and this includes academic status.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
          <h5>Who is running this event?</h5>
          <p>This event is run by Hacksmiths - the student-run tech society at Goldsmiths.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
          <h5>Do I need a team?</h5>
          <p>You don’t need a team to take part; it’s perfectly acceptable to create a solo project. However, during the event itself, there will be opportunities to share ideas and connect with your fellow hackers to form a team. As organisers, we’ll do our best to encourage and facilitate teamwork across the weekend.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
          <h5>Do I have to stay overnight?</h5>
          <p>No, it is not a requisite to stay over. If you would like to stay though, we'll have a small number of airbeds available. We recommend you bring sleeping bags, pillows, and a change of clothes.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
          <h5>Can I start before?</h5>
          <p>While you can explore ideas before the event, you shouldn't start your project before the event itself and still enter the challenges. If you want to bring an existing project to the table, we encourage full disclosure and honesty.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
