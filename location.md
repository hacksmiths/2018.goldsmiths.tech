  <p>In this workshop, we'll be looking at how the <a href="https://www.pozyx.io/">Pozyx</a> system can be used to aid theatre-makers, game designers and computational artists in their work. As well as building some cool stuff, we hope to seed potential future collaborative relationships between people working in different disciplines.</p>
  <p>The event is completely free, and lunch will be provided.</p>
  <h3>Who's involved?</h3>
  <p>fanSHEN create theatre, live events and interactive experiences. We take big, complex ideas, like climate change or political agency, and synthesise them into playful, dynamic formats.</p>
  <p>Near Now is Broadway's studio for arts, design and innovation. They work with people and companies to make, and make sense of, technology in everyday life.</p>
